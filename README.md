# Why Polynomial Regression?
- To understand the need for polynomial regression, let’s generate some random dataset first.
The data generated looks like

- Let’s apply a linear regression model to this dataset. The plot of the best fit line is

- We can see that the straight line is unable to capture the patterns in the data. This is an example of under-fitting
To overcome under-fitting, we need to increase the complexity of the model.
Increase complexity of model my adding more parameters

Fitting a linear regression model on the transformed features gives the below plot.
